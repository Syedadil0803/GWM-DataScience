# GWM-DataScience
This repository showcases a machine learning model for classifying Iris flowers. Using a popular dataset, we've trained a state-of-the-art classifier to accurately identify three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Our code, built with Python and common libraries like scikit-learn, demonstrates how to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Whether you're a beginner exploring classification or an enthusiast delving into machine learning, this project provides valuable insights and a solid foundation. Feel free to contribute, learn, and adapt this code for your own projects. Happy classifying!
